Cellular automaton base that can be flexibly configured for your tasks.

Flexible parameters: `field size` (`X`, `Y`), `minimum and maximum number of neighbors for life` (`NMin`, `NMax`), `number of simulation iterations` (`iterations`).

Full on python3 with `numpy 1.24.3` and `matplotlib 3.6.2`.
> `pip install numpy matplotlib`
